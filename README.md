I developed this notebook to participate at this competition https://www.datachallenge.it/competitions/47
The goal of the competition was to to create an efficient system that curbs the threat of Malware using machine learning techniques to classify benign and malicious Apps. 

It has to be noted that the competition provided a train and a test dataset. The competition platform provided an evaluation of the quality of the forecasts. However, in order to facilitate the fruition of the present notebook, I will only use the train dataset and provided an evaluation of the forecast based on the information I already have.
